\textbf{\textit{Abstract}} - This paper presents the theoretical implementation of a short distance
depth perception sensor, based on multiple axis stereopsis. The sensor is made up of \(7\) distinct 
sensing areas, arranged in a honeycomb pattern, each area meant to capture a separate perspective 
of the subject scene. Due to their arrangement, the sensing areas can be used as independent 
sources for a stereoptic system, or can be combined to form distinct sensing patterns that would
then be used to determine the depth of the elements within the scene.
