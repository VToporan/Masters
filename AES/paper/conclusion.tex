\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a depth measuring image sensor, designed for configurability and short distance
accuracy. It is based on a honeycomb structure of phototransistor arrays, capable of being interlinked
in order to capture the same scene on up to \(7\) distinct image planes, that are then compared 
in order to determine disparity images on up to \(3\) different planar axes. It also showcases
a 3-dimensional configuration of the honeycomb pattern, used to generate greater differences 
between the image planes, as well as an increase field-of-view.
