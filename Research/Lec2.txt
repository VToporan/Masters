State of the art:
  - critical discussion
  - presents both advantages and disadvantages on a specific technique
  - comparative analysis leads to better understanding
  - at the end, a list of current problems can (should) be presented

Best tool - Mathematics

Engineer 
  - capable of building a project form scratch.

Master 
  - studies + publications
  - comparative study
  - simulations or performance evaluation for different techniques
  - can include implementation, but is not enough
  - combination of preexisting techniques

PhD
  - new method or combination of methods
  - new evaluation techniques
  - no implementation needed
  - can be just mathematical model and simulations

Steps 
  - discussing theme with a coordinator
  - reading in the area (state of the art)
  - select a problem to solve
  - focus (work only on the same problem)
  - publish (or perish)
