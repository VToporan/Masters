COURSE:
Emergence is used in systems based on reactive agents
External observers are required in order to determine weather a system is emergent
It requires interactions between entities and the environment
Interactions can be sequential (ant following) as well as parallel (bird flocking)
Emergent systems are not reliable for critical tasks

Deliberative systems require planning, considering the environment as a collection of states
Through mathematical means, the systems determines the most desirable state
SPA Architecture - Sensing + Planning + Acting - have serious drawbacks:
    - Long time to determine each choice of state (can be resolved through state hierarchy)
    - Amount of states is constrained by storage space
    - Requires planning
Trend is to move away from SPA towards more reactive systems
For hybrid systems, the decision is split into reactive or deliberative, based on the momentary requirement
Middle-ware balances the two systems based on their advantages

Universal plans - AI that can work in any environment

LAB:
Source next to Sink

Task1:
GoTo - Pedestrian goes from Source to GoTo and return to Sink

Task2:
GoTo on top and GoTo on bottom
PedSelect to determine the GoTo chosen by a Pedestrian
Pedestrian needs to return along the same route
PedSelect to chose the return trip based on Pedestrian initial choice
Idea: Extend Pedestrian to store GoTo value
      Use Pedestrian color to store GoTo
