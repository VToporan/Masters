COURSE:
Emergence arises from interactions between entities
Emegent behaviour => displayed only in collectives, has a minimum and maximum number of entities that generate it
The entity that is part of the emergent behavior must be "very stupid" (act irrationally)

Color and friction - not observable at microscopic level, derive from the interaction between atoms

Stock market - resulting from the interaction of individuals within a discrete set of rules

SPRAY computers => microscopic computers that can be sprayed on a wall and used as a display
                   each robot has a laser, and acts as an individual pixel

Ants => communicate through pheromones (1-2 molecules / ant), that degrade over time
        they follow the same path towards the food and back
        if something blocks the track, more ants pass around it through the shortest path, marking it with more pheromones

Reactive behavior is faster than pre-programmed behaviour (spinal reflex vs brain processing) 
Partly pre-programmed and partly reactive is the best solution
