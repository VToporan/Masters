COURSE:

Sate machines:
 - 1D => state can be determined from inputs
 - 2D => narrow applications (such as bacteria)

Cellular automata:
 - based on the chosen neighborhood and rules, emergence can be generated

Bird flocking (boyd rules):
  - cohesion: fly towards average od other flock-mates
  - separation: avoid local flock-mates
  - alignment: fly in the same direction as flock-mates

Segregation:
  - moore neighborhood
  - white changes to black if there are X black cells around
  - black changes to white if there are X white cells around
  - complication: only specific white / black cells can turn

 LAB:

 Combo Ped + Proc
 When food appears an ant appears (and goes to it based on the rules from Lab1)
 After food is released, ant returns
