\section{Conclusion}

This paper proposes an HDR system based on a feedback loop on top of a preexisting linear-logarithmic pixel implementation, in order
to increase the amount of time the pixel outputs in linear mode. The variable cutoff point ensures that the optimal
dynamic range for the current lighting conditions. At the same time, it is ensured that the system will resume a stable
state, regardless of the spike in environmental values.
