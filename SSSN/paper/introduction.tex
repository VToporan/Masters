\section{Introduction}

Image capture based on active-pixel sensor (APS) supports a significantly lower dynamic range (DR), between \(55dB\) and \(80dB\),
compared to human perception, at around \(90dB\), with real-world scenes able to surpass \(180dB\). For this
reason, several methods for increasing DR have been researched in the past decades, including sampling multiple 
frames at different exposures \cite{withSampling}, modifying the integration time on the fly \cite{withTime}, and
switching between linear and logarithmic response to the charge build-up \cite{withTable, withScience, withCompensation}.

This paper presents an architecture based on the linear-logarithmic pixel based on charge compensation \cite{withCompensation},
as it induces the least amount of overhead. It also makes use of the independently self-actuated design choices
of the variable integration time \cite{withTime}, in order to generate a specific dynamic range for each individual
pixel.
