\textbf{\textit{Abstract}} - This paper presents a charge compensated photosensor, designed for variable dynamic
range, based on environmental conditions. The pixel is based on a three-transistor active pixel sensor, able to
switch between linear and logarithmic outpus, based on a self-actuating threshold voltage. The system is meant to
reduce the amout of data provided in logarithmic domain, in order to achieve greater accuracy for low light conditions.
