a. Part* one: a presentation containing definitions, characteristics, state of the art, research directions, open problems, main 
implementations; all should be connected to the project you have chosen; for example if you have chosen “Routing protocols in WSN”, 
then part one should refer to routing protocols in WSNs and not in general to WSNs;

b. Part two: a detailed description of a scientific paper which was published in a specialty scientific journal or in the 
proceedings of a specialty conference; the source of the paper must be mentioned in References and CANNOT be a general purpose 
journal (even from the IT field);

c. Part three: an original idea/approach/application, presented as a scientific paper in IEEE format; I suggest a connection to 
the previously described paper but it is only a suggestion;

d. Part four: References: books, scientific journals, proceedings of specialty conferences, links (NOT only links).
